      :NONE,    0x00000000, # Default

      :NEW,     0x00000001, # Indicates the arrival of a new pointer.

      :INRANGE, 0x00000002, # Indicates that this pointer continues to exist. When this flag is not set,
      # it indicates the pointer has left detection range. This flag is typically not set only when a hovering pointer
      # leaves detection range (POINTER_FLAG_UPDATE is set) or when a pointer in contact with a window surface leaves
      # detection range (POINTER_FLAG_UP is set).

      :INCONTACT, 0x00000004, #Indicates that this pointer is in contact with the digitizer surface.
      # When this flag is not set, it indicates a hovering pointer.

      :FIRSTBUTTON, 0x00000010, # Indicates a primary action, analogous to a left mouse button down.
      #A touch pointer has this flag set when it is in contact with the digitizer surface.
      #A pen pointer has this flag set when it is in contact with the digitizer surface with no buttons pressed.
      #A mouse pointer has this flag set when the left mouse button is down.

      :SECONDBUTTON, 0x00000020, # Indicates a secondary action, analogous to a right mouse button down.
      #A touch pointer does not use this flag. A pen pointer has this flag set when it is in contact with the
      # digitizer surface with the pen barrel button pressed.A mouse pointer has this flag set when the right mouse
      # button is down.

      :THIRDBUTTON, 0x00000040, # Analogous to a mouse wheel button down. A touch pointer does not use
      # this flag. A pen pointer does not use this flag. A mouse pointer has this flag set when the mouse wheel button
      # is down.

      :FOURTHBUTTON, 0x00000080, # Analogous to a first extended mouse (XButton1) button down.
      # A touch pointer does not use this flag.
      # A pen pointer does not use this flag.
      # A mouse pointer has this flag set when the first extended mouse (XBUTTON1) button is down.

      :FIFTHBUTTON, 0x00000100, # Analogous to a second extended mouse (XButton2) button down.
      # A touch pointer does not use this flag.
      # A pen pointer does not use this flag.
      # A mouse pointer has this flag set when the second extended mouse (XBUTTON2) button is down.

      :PRIMARY, 0x00002000, # Indicates that this pointer has been designated as the primary pointer.
      # A primary pointer is a single pointer that can perform actions beyond those available to non-primary pointers.
      # For example, when a primary pointer makes contact with a window’s surface, it may provide the window an
      # opportunity to activate by sending it a WM_POINTERACTIVATE message. The primary pointer is identified from all
      # current user interactions on the system (mouse, touch, pen, and so on). As such, the primary pointer might not
      # be associated with your app. The first contact in a multi-touch interaction is set as the primary pointer.
      # Once a primary pointer is identified, all contacts must be lifted before a new contact can be identified as a
      # primary pointer. For apps that don't process pointer input, only the primary pointer's events are promoted to
      # mouse events.

      :CONFIDENCE, 0x000004000, # Confidence is a suggestion from the source device about whether the
      # pointer represents an intended or accidental interaction, which is especially relevant for PT_TOUCH pointers
      # where an accidental interaction (such as with the palm of the hand) can trigger input. The presence of this
      # flag indicates that the source device has high confidence that this input is part of an intended interaction.

      :POINTER_FLAG_CANCELED, 0x000008000, #Indicates that the pointer is departing in an abnormal manner, such as
      # when the system receives invalid input for the pointer or when a device with active pointers departs abruptly.
      # If the application receiving the input is in a position to do so, it should treat the interaction as not
      # completed and reverse any effects of the concerned pointer.

      :POINTER_FLAG_DOWN, 0x00010000, # Indicates that this pointer transitioned to a down state; that is, it made
      # contact with the digitizer surface.

      :POINTER_FLAG_UPDATE, 0x00020000, # Indicates that this is a simple update that does not include pointer state
      # changes.

      :POINTER_FLAG_UP, 0x00040000, # Indicates that this pointer transitioned to an up state; that is, it broke
      # contact with the digitizer surface.

      :POINTER_FLAG_WHEEL, 0x00080000, # Indicates input associated with a pointer wheel. For mouse pointers, this is
      # equivalent to the action of the mouse scroll wheel (WM_MOUSEWHEEL).

      :POINTER_FLAG_HWHEEL, 0x00100000, # Indicates input associated with a pointer h-wheel. For mouse pointers, this
      # is equivalent to the action of the mouse horizontal scroll wheel (WM_MOUSEHWHEEL).

      :POINTER_FLAG_CAPTURECHANGED, 0x00200000, # Indicates that this pointer was captured by (associated with)
      # another element and the original element has lost capture (see WM_POINTERCAPTURECHANGED)

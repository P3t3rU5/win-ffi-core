         # Modality --------------------

         # The user must respond to the message box before continuing work in the
         # window identified by the hWnd parameter. However, the user can move to the
         # windows of other threads and work in those windows.
         # Depending on the hierarchy of windows in the application, the user may be
         # able to move to other windows within the thread. All child windows of the
         # parent of the message box are automatically disabled, but pop-up windows are
         # not.
         # MB_APPLMODAL is the default if neither MB_SYSTEMMODAL nor MB_TASKMODAL
         # is specified.

         # Use system-modal message boxes to notify the user of serious, potentially
         # damaging errors that require immediate attention (for example, running out
         # of memory). This flag has no effect on the user's ability to interact with
         # windows other than those associated with hWnd.
         :systemmodal, 0x00001000,
         # Same as MB_APPLMODAL except that all the top-level windows belonging to the
         # current thread are disabled if the hWnd parameter is NULL. Use this flag
         # when the calling application or library does not have a window handle
         # available but still needs to prevent input to other windows in the calling
         # thread without suspending other threads.

         # Other -----------------------

         # Same as desktop of the interactive window station. For more information,

         # return until the user switches to the default desktop.

         # function directs the message box to the session specified in the
         # impersonation token.
         # If this flag is set, the hWnd parameter must be NULL. This is so that the
         # message box can appear on a desktop other than the desktop corresponding to
         # the hWnd.
         # For information on security considerations in regard to using this flag, see
         # Interactive Services. In particular, be aware that this flag can produce
         # interactive content on a locked desktop and should therefore be used for
         # only a very limited set of scenarios, such as resource exhaustion.

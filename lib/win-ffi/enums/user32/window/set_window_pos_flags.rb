        :NOZORDER, 0x0004, # Retains the current Z order (ignores the hWndInsertAfter parameter).

        :NOREDRAW, 0x0008, # Does not redraw changes. If this flag is set, no repainting of any kind occurs. This
        # applies to the client area, the nonclient area (including the title bar and scroll bars), and any part of the
        # parent window uncovered as a result of the window being moved. When this flag is set, the application must
        # explicitly invalidate or redraw any parts of the window and parent window that need redrawing.

        :NOACTIVATE, 0x0010, # Does not activate the window. If this flag is not set, the window is activated and moved
        # to the top of either the topmost or non-topmost group (depending on the setting of the hWndInsertAfter
        # parameter).

        :DRAWFRAME, 0x0020, # Draws a frame (defined in the window's class description) around the window.

        :FRAMECHANGED, 0x0020, # Applies new frame styles set using the SetWindowLong function. Sends a WM_NCCALCSIZE
        # message to the window, even if the window's size is not being changed. If this flag is not specified,
        # WM_NCCALCSIZE is sent only when the window's size is being changed.

        :HIDEWINDOW, 0x0080, # Hides the window.

        :NOCOPYBITS, 0x0100, # Discards the entire contents of the client area. If this flag is not specified, the valid
        # contents of the client area are saved and copied back into the client area after the window is sized or
        # repositioned.

        :NOOWNERZORDER, 0x0200, # Does not change the owner window's position in the Z order.

        :NOREPOSITION, 0x0200, # Same as the :NOOWNERZORDER flag.

        :NOSENDCHANGING, 0x0400, # Prevents the window from receiving the WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING message.

        :DEFERERASE, 0x2000, # Prevents generation of the WM_SYNCPAINT message.

                                 # input queues, the system posts the request to the thread that owns the window. This prevents the calling
                                 # thread from blocking its execution while other threads process the request.

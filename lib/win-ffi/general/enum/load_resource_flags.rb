      # corresponding entry in the color table with the default window color (COLOR_WINDOW). All pixels in the image
      # that use that entry become the default window color. This value applies only to images that have corresponding
      # color tables.
      :DEFAULTSIZE, 0x00000040, # Uses the width or height specified by the system metric values for cursors or icons,
      # if the cxDesired or cyDesired values are set to zero. If this flag is not specified and cxDesired and
      # cyDesired are set to zero, the function uses the actual resource size. If the resource contains multiple

      # a DIB section bitmap rather than a compatible bitmap. This flag is useful for loading a bitmap without mapping
      # it to the colors of the display device.
      # Do not use this option if you are loading a bitmap with a color depth greater than 8bpp.
      # If fuLoad includes both the :LOADTRANSPARENT and :LOADMAP3DCOLORS values, :LOADTRANSPARENT takes precedence.

      :SHARED,           0x00008000, # Shares the image handle if the image is loaded multiple times. If :SHARED is not set, a
      # second call to LoadImage for the same resource will load the image again and return a different handle.
      # When you use this flag, the system will destroy the resource when it is no longer needed.
      # Do not use :SHARED for images that have non-standard sizes, that may change after loading, or that are loaded
      # from a file. When loading a system icon or cursor, you must use :SHARED or the function will fail to load the
      # resource. This function finds the first image in the cache with the requested resource name, regardless of the
      # size requested.

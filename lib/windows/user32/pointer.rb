          # A primary pointer is a single pointer that can perform actions beyond those available to non-primary pointers.
          # For example, when a primary pointer makes contact with a windowâ€™s surface, it may provide the window an
          # opportunity to activate by sending it a WM_POINTERACTIVATE message. The primary pointer is identified from all
          # current user interactions on the system (mouse, touch, pen, and so on). As such, the primary pointer might not
          # be associated with your app. The first contact in a multi-touch interaction is set as the primary pointer.
          # Once a primary pointer is identified, all contacts must be lifted before a new contact can be identified as a
          # primary pointer. For apps that don't process pointer input, only the primary pointer's events are promoted to
          # mouse events.

          # when the system receives invalid input for the pointer or when a device with active pointers departs abruptly.
          # If the application receiving the input is in a position to do so, it should treat the interaction as not
          # completed and reverse any effects of the concerned pointer.

          :POINTER_FLAG_DOWN, 0x00010000, # Indicates that this pointer transitioned to a down state; that is, it made
          # contact with the digitizer surface.

          # changes.

          :POINTER_FLAG_UP, 0x00040000, # Indicates that this pointer transitioned to an up state; that is, it broke
          # contact with the digitizer surface.
